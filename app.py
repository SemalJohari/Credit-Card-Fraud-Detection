### Credit Card Fraud Detection App:

This application predicts whether a credit card transaction is **fraudulent** or **legitimate** 
based on features derived from anonymized data. The model has been trained on the 
Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset, which includes features like time, amount, and anonymized
features V1-V28.

You can input the transaction details below:

            ### Terminologies:
            1. Time: The seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
            2. Amount: The transaction amount in USD.
            3. V1 to V28: Anonymized features derived from the original transaction data using principal
                    component analysis (PCA) to protect sensitive information. These features capture 
                    patterns and relationships indicative of fraudulent or legitimate behavior.
